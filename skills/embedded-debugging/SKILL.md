# Embedded debugging over a debug probe

You are talking to a physical microcontroller through a debug probe. It is
slower, more stateful, and far less forgiving than a process on your machine.

The single rule that matters: **the device is the source of truth, and it is
cheap to ask it.** Nearly every wrong answer in this domain comes from
reasoning about what the hardware "should" be doing instead of reading it.

## Before you debug anything: two files that change everything

Most sessions are needlessly blind because these were never supplied. Check
`get_config` at the start and ask for whichever is missing.

### The ELF gives you names

Without it you do not merely lose names — you lose the stack. Measured on an
nRF52840, the same halted target, one `gdb_load` apart:

```
# no symbols
#0  0x00000048 in ?? ()

# after gdb_load
#0  0x00000048 in rtt_puts (s=s@entry=0x520 "] <") at src/fixture.c:124
#1  0x000001c2 in log_line (level=0x59b "inf", module=0x54a "hil_fixture",
                            msg=0x58d "fixture ready") at src/fixture.c:158
#2  0x000002fa in main () at src/fixture.c:282
```

One anonymous frame becomes three named ones with arguments and line numbers.
GDB cannot unwind past the top frame without the debug info, so "the caller"
is not a question you can even ask until the ELF is loaded.

```
gdb_load { elfFile: "build/zephyr/zephyr.elf" }     # symbols only, does not touch flash
```

This does **not** reprogram the device — it loads symbols into GDB. Pass
`flash: true` only when you actually intend to program it. The server halts
the target briefly to run it and puts it back, so you do not have to. Load the ELF that
matches the firmware currently on the target; a stale ELF gives confidently
wrong function names, which is worse than `??`.

Once loaded: `gdb_backtrace`, and `gdb_command` for `info locals`,
`print myStruct`, `x/16xw &buffer`, and turning a faulting address into a line:

```
info line *0x2a4
Line 91 of "src/fixture.c" starts at address 0x2a4 <main> and ends at 0x2a8 <main+4>.
```

### The SVD gives you meanings

Without it, a peripheral read is a hex word you have to decode by hand against
a 2000-page reference manual. With it, `read_peripheral` and `decode_register`
split the value into named fields with their enumerated meanings — `ENABLE = 4
(Enabled)` instead of `0x00000004`.

Set `SVD_PATH` (standalone) or `jlinkMcp.svdPath` (VSCode) to a CMSIS-SVD file
for the exact part. Vendors publish them; they are also in CMSIS device family
packs and the `cmsis-svd` collection. `list_peripherals` tells you immediately
whether one is loaded.

### While you are there: `JLINK_RTT_ADDR`

Set it to your firmware's `_SEGGER_RTT` symbol. The probe locates the RTT
control block by scanning RAM and never reports the address back, so without
this RTT cannot be recovered after a reset or a flash — and a stream that
stopped being collected looks exactly like a device that has gone quiet.

## Do not guess a part number

`set_device` needs J-Link's exact name for the chip, and a wrong one fails in
a way that looks like broken hardware rather than a typo. J-Link knows the
list — around 9800 parts — so ask it:

```
search_devices { query: "stm32f407" }
search_devices { query: "nordic" }        # by manufacturer
search_devices { query: "cortex-m33" }    # by core
```

Results carry flash and RAM sizes, which is what separates the variants that
differ by nothing else — an `STM32F407IE` from an `STM32F407IG`. Pass the name
back to `set_device` exactly as written.

## The halt rule

**Reading a running target is impossible, not slow.** The GDB server is a
synchronous remote: while the target runs it stops reading commands, and reads
are refused rather than queued.

So every inspection is: halt → read → resume. If a read comes back refused,
that is not a flaky probe, it is you asking at the wrong moment.

Two traps:

- **A core spinning in its fault handler counts as "running."** It will refuse
  reads exactly like healthy firmware. Halt first, then read — this is why
  `diagnose_crash` halts before it reads anything.
- **You cannot hold a core halted while RTT is being collected.** The probe
  collects RTT in stop mode by default: it halts the core, reads the buffer,
  and starts it again. A core "stopped at the reset vector" will not stay
  there. Disconnect RTT if the target genuinely has to stay put.

## Verify, do not infer

Embedded systems punish assumption. For every belief you form, there is a way
to ask the hardware, and it takes one tool call. Some worked examples:

| Belief | How to actually check it |
|---|---|
| "The core is running" | Halt, read a counter, resume, halt, read again. Moving is running. Same PC twice is not proof of a hang — it may be a delay loop. |
| "The reset worked" | Reset, **resume**, then read a `.bss` variable that only climbs. A halting reset stops *before* startup zeroes `.bss`, so checking without resuming proves nothing. |
| "The device stopped logging" | `rtt_status`. It reads the control block and separates the two cases: `WrOff` is the target's write pointer, `RdOff` the host's. `WrOff` moving while `RdOff` sits still means the firmware is fine and the probe stopped collecting. |
| "It's hung" | Check for armed breakpoints. A stale FPB comparator raises a debug event that, with no debugger attached, escalates to HardFault — indistinguishable from a hang. `clear_breakpoints` and re-run. |
| "That register is 0" | Confirm the read succeeded. A refused read and a genuine zero look identical once the value reaches you. |
| "The firmware on the device is the one I built" | Read the vector table or a known constant and compare against your build. Flashing can silently not have happened. |

When two channels disagree, that is information, not noise: if `read_registers`
and `probe_command { commands: ["halt","regs"] }` report different PCs, the core
was moving between the two reads.

## Workflows

### A crash
```
diagnose_crash                    # halts, decodes CFSR/HFSR/DFSR, unwinds the frame
gdb_backtrace                     # needs the ELF, or this is addresses only
gdb_command { command: "info line *0x<faulting PC>" }
rtt_search { level: "err" }       # what the device said before it died
```
`diagnose_crash` reporting no faults is only meaningful if the read succeeded.
It says so explicitly when it could not read — that is not a clean bill of health.

### A hang, or "it does nothing"
```
snapshot                          # registers + faults + stack + RTT in one call
```
Take it twice, a second apart, and compare the PC. Then rule out, in order:
armed breakpoints (`clear_breakpoints`), a fault handler loop (PC inside your
`HardFault_Handler`), and a genuine wait (PC in a delay or a semaphore).

### A peripheral behaving oddly
```
list_peripherals { filter: "uart" }
read_peripheral { peripheral: "UARTE0" }
decode_register { peripheral: "UARTE0", register: "ENABLE" }
```
Compare what the registers say against what the code intended to write. The
gap between the two is usually the bug — a clock left off, a pin not routed, a
peripheral enabled before it was configured.

### A device that boots and then goes silent
Distinguish three cases before theorising: the firmware stopped, the probe
stopped collecting, or the log level filters it.

```
rtt_status              # separates "quiet device" from "probe not collecting"
snapshot                # is the PC still moving?
rtt_search {}           # is it logging below your filter?
```

## Session hygiene

- `start_debug_session` is one call for GDB server + GDB client + resume + RTT
  + boot log. The order matters: attaching GDB halts the target, so RTT is
  connected only after the target has resumed and initialized its control block.
  Prefer it over assembling the pieces.
- `gdb_server_stop` clears debug state, disconnects the GDB client and RTT, then
  stops the server. Use it at the end of a session so the probe is released.
- If startup reports a GDB attach failure, retry `start_debug_session` or
  `gdb_server_start`; a server started by that failed call is already cleaned
  up, while a pre-existing server remains available for `gdb_connect`.
- Check the reported GDB transport before choosing a client path. J-Link and
  OpenOCD expose TCP; Black Magic Probe exposes its built-in GDB endpoint over
  serial and does not accept the generic TCP `gdb_connect` tool.
- **A probe serves one client at a time.** If something reports the probe busy,
  another GDB server or a stray JLinkExe has it — that is a real constraint,
  not a transient error to retry blindly.
- Clear breakpoints before you leave. A comparator left armed outlives your
  session and will fault the *next* firmware that happens to execute that
  address, which is a genuinely horrible bug to inherit.
- Tools report failure in their reply text. Read it. A tool that says
  "Reset failed: ..." has not reset anything, whatever you do next.
