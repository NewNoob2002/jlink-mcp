# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- Unified J-Link GDB Server startup and teardown between the VS Code extension
  and MCP backend through `GDBServerManager`.
- `start_debug_session` now starts the server, attaches GDB, resumes the target,
  and only then connects RTT. GDB session failures are returned to the caller.
- Stopping a GDB Server disconnects the GDB client and RTT before releasing the
  probe.
- Serialized backend access and protected `ProcessManager` entries from stale
  child-process callbacks deleting a replacement process.
- Declared GDB transport in status output: TCP for J-Link/OpenOCD and serial for
  Black Magic Probe.
- Unified RTT connection state updates and surfaced RTT recovery results.
- Failed session startup now releases a server started by that attempt instead
  of leaving the probe occupied after a GDB attach failure.

## 0.7.0

Three rounds of pointing a fresh agent at real hardware and reading its
complaints. Most of what it found was tools stating things they had not
checked — and two of its own most confident findings turned out to be
misdiagnoses, which is its own lesson about how these reports should be read.

### Added

- **`rtt_status`** — reads SEGGER's control block and reports what the target
  has written against what the probe has collected. The skill had been telling
  people to go and read those pointers when a device goes quiet, and nothing
  could. It refuses to print pointer values when the control block ID is
  absent, because those words are not pointers, they are whatever is in RAM.
- **`set_svd_path`** and **`set_rtt_address`** — runtime setters mirroring
  `set_device`. Every tool nagged about `SVD_PATH` and `JLINK_RTT_ADDR` while
  offering no way to supply either, which is worse than silence. Someone
  holding the exact values, read from a symbol table minutes earlier, had
  nowhere to put them.
- **`rtt_read { oldest: true }`** — only the newest lines were ever reachable,
  so a boot banner scrolled away the moment a device got chatty.

### Fixed — tools that stated what they had not checked

- **`diagnose_crash` invented a fault on a healthy device.** The stacked
  exception frame exists only when the CPU takes an exception; with none, the
  words at SP are ordinary locals. It read them anyway and announced a
  faulting PC outside flash, three lines after "No faults detected". It also
  halted the core without saying so — which is how `rtt_status` came to report
  "Silence here is a quiet device" about a CPU another tool had stopped.
- **A watchpoint firing was reported as a bare `SIGTRAP`**, with no
  expression and no old/new value. The hardware worked; the evidence was being
  rendered away, and 25 minutes went into concluding watchpoints were broken.
- **`probe_command` swapped the probe's own words for advice.** It is the
  escape hatch people reach for when the cooked tools have failed them, and it
  was returning "Recovery failed. Try: 1) reset with halt..." in place of a
  full J-Link transcript.
- **`gdb_server_start` asserted a cause it could not know**, telling people to
  hunt for a competing process while the server's own words were "Could not
  connect to target" and the same output proved the probe was not contended.
- **`check_setup` reported no probe on a working one.** J-Link words the same
  success two ways depending on the machine, and the check was written from
  one of them.
- **`gdb_backtrace` told people to load symbols they had already loaded.** A
  trailing `?? ()` frame is the unwinder running past `main` and appears in
  healthy output; only frame #0 says anything.
- **`snapshot { rttLines: 0 }` returned 495 KB.** Zero meant "unlimited" to
  the buffer read.
- **The server announced version 0.3.2** while the package was 0.6.0 — three
  releases stale, hardcoded. It reads `package.json` now, and a test bans
  version literals in `src/` outright.
- **`search_devices` connected to the target** to read a list compiled into
  the DLL. It no longer autoconnects, and the list is cached per J-Link
  installation: 326 ms cold, 9 ms warm.
- **`set_breakpoint` reported where it was asked for, not where it landed.**
  A breakpoint set by file:line can resolve into the middle of a loop.
- **A peripheral filter that matched nothing said nothing useful** — it now
  lists what the part actually has. A chip whose I2C blocks are called TWIM
  will never answer to "i2c", and the caller had no way to discover that.

## 0.6.0

Aimed at two things reported from real use: models never loaded the ELF, so
every backtrace was bare addresses, and they reasoned about the hardware
instead of asking it. Both turned out to have a cause in the server, not only
in the model.

### Added

- **An `embedded-debugging` skill**, shipped as a Claude Code plugin
  (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` + `skills/`). Covers the two files that change
  everything — the ELF for names, an SVD for meanings — the halt/read/resume
  rule and its traps, workflows for crashes, hangs, peripherals and silent
  devices, and a table pairing each tempting assumption with the tool call
  that settles it. MCP itself has no skills primitive; its portable equivalent
  is prompts, and this server ships four.
- **Capability hints.** Tools now say what the session is missing, attached to
  the answer that is worse for missing it: an unresolved backtrace names
  `gdb_load`, peripheral tools name `SVD_PATH`, an empty RTT read names
  `JLINK_RTT_ADDR`. Only absent capabilities are mentioned, and all but the
  backtrace hint fire once a session. Net context cost is negative — the old
  "no SVD" message was forty tokens of advice on three tools on every call.
- **S4**, a hardware suite for debug symbols. The fixture ELF had been
  exported and unused since the harness was written.

### Added

- **`search_devices`.** `set_device` needs J-Link's exact spelling of a part,
  and the only guidance was two examples — so callers guessed part numbers,
  and a wrong guess fails in a way that looks like broken hardware. J-Link
  publishes the answer: `ExpDevList` dumps 9818 devices across 75
  manufacturers. Searchable by part number, manufacturer or core, with flash
  and RAM sizes to separate variants that differ by nothing else.
- **A status bar that says who has the probe.** A J-Link serves one client at
  a time, and the usual way that bites is an assistant leaving a GDB server
  running. The extension could not see that — the MCP server is a separate
  process — so it now watches the GDB port, which is true whoever is
  responsible, and reads `J-Link · MCP · 47m`. Clicking frees the probe. It
  will not kill a process it cannot identify as a J-Link GDB server.
- **`server.json`**, so the server can be listed in the MCP registry, plus a
  `marketplace.json` making the repo installable as a Claude Code plugin.

### Fixed

- **Loading symbols no longer requires a halted target.** `file` is answered
  by GDB from debug info it already holds and never reaches the probe, but the
  running-target guard refused it anyway — so the first thing anyone should do
  in a session was rejected at exactly the moment anyone would do it, on a
  device nobody had halted yet. A narrow allow-list of genuinely host-side
  commands now passes through; `print` and `x` stay behind the guard because
  they read target memory.
- **`gdb_load` reported "Symbols loaded" for a load that was refused**, with
  nothing after the colon. The caller then stops trying, and every later
  backtrace is anonymous for a reason it has been told is already solved.
- **A peripheral filter that matched nothing said nothing useful.** It now
  lists what the part actually has — a chip whose I2C blocks are called TWIM
  will never answer to "i2c", and the caller had no way to discover that. The
  filter is also trimmed now; ` i2c ` matched nothing.
- **Three README badges no longer rendered.** Shields retired the entire
  visual-studio-marketplace family and there is no replacement, so the VS Code
  badge makes no version claim and a release badge carries the version
  instead. The Smithery badge and link were removed — that server was never
  listed. The npm downloads badge was silently redirecting to a different
  metric.

## 0.5.1

Marketplace metadata only — no code changes, and nothing to gain by upgrading
if you already have 0.5.0.

0.5.0 was published from a build made before the listing was updated, so it
went out with the old name and keyword set. This carries them:

- The listing is now named for what it does rather than for the package:
  "J-Link MCP — Embedded Debugging for AI Agents". The identifier is unchanged.
- Keywords cover the terms people actually search — `jlink` unhyphenated,
  `gdb`, `swd`, `jtag`, `mcu`, the device families this is used against
  (`nrf52`, `nordic`, `stm32`, `zephyr`), `svd` and `cmsis` for the peripheral
  decoding added in 0.5.0, and `copilot`/`ai`/`llm`.
- Added the `AI` category alongside `Debuggers`.
- The npm tarball dropped from 2.2 MB to 332 kB: it was shipping the
  marketplace icon and 2.2 MB of source maps pointing at a `src/` tree that is
  not published.

## 0.5.0

Another hardware round, and another set of operations that reported success
while doing nothing. Each one here was hidden behind the one before it: fixing
reset made reset actually happen, which exposed the teardown; fixing the
teardown exposed a GDB server that had already exited; fixing that left one
clean question about RTT, which a diagnostic answered in a single run.

### Fixed

- **`reset` did nothing at all, and said it worked.** The J-Link GDB server is
  a synchronous remote and stops reading stdin while the target runs, so every
  command of the reset sequence was refused in turn and the failure discarded.
  A reset is a recovery action — the moment you reach for one is exactly when
  the target is running — so it now halts out of band first. `reset(halt)`
  also verifies its own postcondition, following VTOR to the reset vector
  rather than assuming the vector table sits at zero.
- **Session teardown never disarmed anything.** `disarmDebugState()` writes FPB
  comparators, DWT functions, `FP_CTRL` and `DEMCR` through the debug channel,
  and teardown happens while the target is running by definition — so the
  whole routine was refused, write by write, and reported "debug hardware
  disarmed" regardless. The guarantee that a session leaves the target
  bootable had never actually held over a live session. It halts first now.
- **A GDB server was reported running when it had already exited.** Startup
  returned on the spawn without waiting to see whether it got the probe. A
  J-Link serves one client at a time, so when another process still holds it
  the server prints "Connecting to J-Link failed" and exits about 200 ms
  later. One test suite tore down and the next started 2.2 s later, lost the
  probe, and ran its entire length with no GDB server and no RTT. Startup now
  waits for the server's own readiness banner and retries a busy probe: a USB
  device is not free the instant the process holding it is signalled.
- **RTT went silent after a target reset.** Sampling SEGGER's control block
  from both ends showed the target's write pointer moving 582 to 802 while the
  host's read pointer stayed at 0 — the firmware was still logging and the
  probe had stopped collecting. Reconnecting the telnet client cannot help;
  that is downstream of the collector. `reset` now restarts collection via
  `SetRTTAddr`, and where it cannot it says so rather than leaving a dead
  stream looking like a quiet target.

### Changed

- **Reset strategy is selectable**, via `strategy` on the `reset` tool
  (`RSetType` / `monitor reset <type>`). Omitting it lets J-Link pick the right
  sequence for the device, which is what SEGGER recommends. The hand-rolled
  `DEMCR.VC_CORERESET` vector catch is gone: J-Link's default Cortex-M strategy
  already does exactly that, and doing it by hand opted out of the per-device
  handling. Backends with no numeric reset types refuse an explicit strategy
  rather than quietly resetting some other way.

- **An assignment that was silently discarded** took RTT out for the rest of a
  session. `rttConnected` decides whether a flash restores RTT afterwards, and
  its setter refused the assignment unless a state enum read `GDB_RUNNING` —
  but that enum covers both "the target is attached" and "the server is up",
  and any probe-CLI call runs a preflight that sets `TARGET_ATTACHED`. RTT
  connects just after a resume, which is such a call, so the refusal landed on
  the following line every time. The guard now asks whether a GDB server is
  running, which is the actual rule: the server hosts the RTT port.

### Added

- **`JLINK_RTT_ADDR`** / `jlinkMcp.rtt.controlBlockAddress` — the address of
  your firmware's `_SEGGER_RTT` symbol. J-Link locates the control block by
  scanning RAM and never reports the address back, so supplying it is what
  allows RTT to survive a reset.
- **Reset strategy selection** on the `reset` tool, and a postcondition check
  on `reset(halt)` that follows VTOR to the reset vector.

## 0.4.0

The first release with a hardware test suite behind it. Every fix below was
found by running the server against a real nRF52840-DK, and most of them were
failures that reported success — the kind you cannot find by reading the code.

### Fixed — tools that lied

- **`diagnose_crash` reported "No faults detected" during real crashes.** Twice,
  for two different reasons: the memory-dump parser dropped half of every line
  at J-Link's mid-line byte-group separator, and later, a target spinning in
  its own fault handler counts as "running" to a synchronous remote, so the
  register reads were refused and refused reads defaulted to zero. It now halts
  before reading, and a failed read says so instead of reporting health.
- **Every GDB-routed tool returned empty output** while `gdb_server_status`
  reported the server healthy. Response completion matched a `(gdb)` prompt
  that GDB emits at startup, before any command is sent, so every reply was off
  by one. Commands now carry MI tokens.
- **`read_memory` returned the wrong number of bytes.** J-Link parses `mem`'s
  length as bare hex, so `read_memory(addr, 256)` read 598 bytes.
- **`read_register` was rejected for its own documented examples.** `rreg PC`
  answers "Illegal register name" — and so does `rreg R15`. It now reads the
  full set and picks the register out.
- **RTT dropped and garbled lines.** ANSI escapes were stripped per TCP chunk,
  so a sequence split across a read leaked raw bytes into the log and broke
  level/module filtering for that line.

### Fixed — sessions that broke silently

- **`flash` and `erase` killed a live GDB session.** They must spawn JLinkExe,
  and a probe serves one client, so the server was evicted and the client left
  on a dead socket. They now take the session down deliberately and restore it,
  reporting each step.
- **Disconnecting left the target unbootable.** Sessions ended with breakpoint
  comparators still armed; a probe-issued reset does not clear them, so the next
  boot took a debug event with nothing attached and HardFaulted. Teardown now
  clears breakpoints and disarms the FPB and DWT comparators.
- **`start_debug_session` halted your firmware and then reported no output.**
  The GDB server halts the core when it attaches. It now resumes before
  connecting RTT, and says so.
- **A running target could not be halted.** With a synchronous remote GDB stops
  reading stdin while the target executes, so no command could reach it. `halt`
  now interrupts out-of-band.
- **Concurrent tool calls could clobber each other's replies.** GDB commands are
  now queued.
- Commands issued while the target runs are refused promptly with an actionable
  message, rather than waiting out a 10-second timeout and returning nothing.

### Fixed — VSCode extension

- **Nine of sixteen settings did nothing.** They appeared in the settings UI and
  were never passed to the server: the whole telnet-proxy group, SWO port, and
  more. Every declared setting is now wired, with a test that fails if the two
  ever diverge again.
- **OpenOCD and Black Magic Probe were unreachable from the extension.** There
  was no setting to select the backend, despite both being documented. Added
  `jlinkMcp.probeType` plus full settings for both.

### Added

- `jlinkMcp.gdbPath` — choose the GDB used for source-level debugging
  (`gdb-multiarch` works if you have no ARM-specific build)
- `jlinkMcp.openocd.*` and `jlinkMcp.blackmagic.*` settings
- A hardware-in-the-loop test suite, and a fast tier that replays real captured
  probe output so format regressions are caught without a probe
- `demo/` — a scripted debugging session driven through the real server

### Removed

- `jlinkMcp.trice.*` and `jlinkMcp.pigweed.*`. These configured a detokenizer
  that was never implemented — the telnet proxy relays bytes and nothing decodes
  them. Settings for an absent feature are worse than no settings: you supply a
  token database and wait for decoded output that is never coming. The proxy
  itself is unchanged and still useful; point your own decoder at it.

### Changed

- `telnet_proxy_start` now describes what it does — relay the RTT stream to
  another port — rather than implying it decodes anything.
- Requires VSCode 1.110+ (unchanged in `engines`; the docs previously said 1.99).
